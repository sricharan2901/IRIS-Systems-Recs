DOCUMENTATION FOR THE COMPLETION OF TASK 7

Name : Sricharan Sridhar
Roll No. : 221IT066

March 16th :

- For this task, I decided to read upon rate limiting.
- First thing I did was to add a command to create a zone to request rate limit at 5 requests per second.
- Inside the server block, I added a statement for the zone created to include a burst of 10 with nodelay.
- I read online about nodelay and it didnt seem much of a difference in our case but generally it would be better if we dont want to constraint the time gap between requests.

- I created the network again using docker-compose and I was able to run it smoothly (difficult to analyse this as hard to access the same page multiple times in a second)

FINAL CHECKS :-

- Added a request limit rate (WORKS)

Hence, task has been completed Successfully.
