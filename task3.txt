DOCUMENTATION FOR THE COMPLETION OF TASK 3

Name : Sricharan Sridhar
Roll No. : 221IT066

March 12th : 

- I decided to read about nginx load balancing. I also read about reverse proxy to figure out what it actually is.
- I decided to use the latest image of nginx which is an official docker image.
- I added a dependency such that the nginx container would depend on the app container, creating a link.

- I initially made a Dockerfile for nginx to create the image, but I figured it wouldnt be needed if im just using the official image.
- I also created a nginx config file (nginx.conf), to configure what the load balancer does.

- It would read on port 8080 (application port) and map it to port 80.
- I configured the load balancer as reverse proxy to the rails application.
- The load balancer would listen on port 80 and load the application container, which in turn would launch the page.

- On creating a network using docker compose, I was able to acheive this.

FINAL CHECKS :-

- Access the application through the load balancer on port 8080 (WORKS)
- Cannot directly access the application (WORKS)

Hence, task has been completed Successfully.
