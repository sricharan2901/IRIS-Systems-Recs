DOCUMENTATION FOR THE COMPLETION OF TASK 6

Name : Sricharan Sridhar
Roll No. : 221IT066

March 15th :

- I have been using docker compose since the second task for linking the DB and the application.
- I just had to make one change, which is that I had to build an image and use that image instead of building the image again and again.
- I made the changes in the docker-compose file and I built the image required.

- The app was launched and was working without errors.

FINAL CHECKS :-

- Use docker compose for creating a network of services (WORKS)
- Use a built image to create the network in a single step (WORKS)

Hence, task has been completed Successfully.
