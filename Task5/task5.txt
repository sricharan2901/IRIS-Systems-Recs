DOCUMENTATION FOR THE COMPLETION OF TASK 5

Name : Sricharan Sridhar
Roll No. : 221IT066

March 14th :

- I had initially gone through info about volume mount and bind mounts.
- I assumed it would be better to go ahead with volume mounts since it would just save everything to the Docker Directory.
- I had incluede a volume for the database named mysql-data and assumed the task was done.

March 16th : 

- When I was having a check of the tasks completed, I was confused a bit about the data persistence.
- I read online and figured that having a volume mount will in turn make me create the volume again and again when the network is created using docker compose.
- It would be no use to have this done as the data is not stored.

- So I created a directory named mysql-datab.
- This would store all data that changes in the mysql directory -> /var/lib/mysql

- I also created a bind mount for the NginX config files.
- This would store data that changes in the nginx directory -> /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf

FINAL CHECKS :-

- Created a Bind mount for the DB (WORKS)
- Created a Bind mount for the NginX config files (WORKS)

Hence, task has been completed Successfully.
