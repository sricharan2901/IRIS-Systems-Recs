DOCUMENTATION FOR THE COMPLETION OF TASK 1

Name : Sricharan Sridhar
Roll No. : 221IT066

March 5th :

- For this task, I initially started reading about the entire set of tasks and understanding how the entire thing works.

March 6th :

- I forked the repo and cloned it to the local system.
- I started making the Dockerfile, which was necessary to build the image for my application

INITIAL MISTAKES:
- I completely ignored the Gemfile and decided to just install a few dependencies on my own
- I also created an image for ruby version 3.1.2, but the app was running on ruby 2.6.1

- I later noticed that and changed the version to a 2.x.x version (2.7.8)
- I installed the gems from the Gemfile using RUN bundle install
- I figured that a newer bundler version needed to be installed, so I installed version 2.4.22 for the image
- I tried to build the image, but once I did and tried to run a container, I realised that NodeJS had to be installed

March 7th : 

- I installed NodeJS through yarn package manager.
- I also installed yarn first and then the packages from yarn.
- I tried to create an entrypoint also (entrypoint.sh)
- The image was built successfully.

FINAL CHECKS :-

- Build an image to pack the application (WORKS)

Hence, task has been completed Successfully.
