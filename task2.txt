DOCUMENTATION FOR THE COMPLETION OF TASK 2

Name : Sricharan Sridhar
Roll No. : 221IT066

March 8th :

- I initially read about docker compose as i figured that inorder to link a DB with the application container, we would need to create a network.
- I tried to launch an application container by running the image built from task1. I was able to run it without errors.
- I tried to run the docker compose file by creating separate services for DB and the image
- Initially I was building the image everytime i ran docker compose.

MISTAKES

- I did not ensure the DB connectivity properly. Hence I was ending up with a MySQL socket error.
- I forgot to add environment variables, which were important in setting up the DB.
- I found them on database.yml file in the config directory.

March 9th :

- I set up the environment variables. Initially I did not create a .env file to first ensure the DB was being set up properly.
- I got the error again. I tried initailizing the server again, trying out different versions of the sql server but I kept getting the error.
- I made changes to the env variables as there were some errors. I tried again and the db container was running properly when I tried docker compose.
- I noticed that the database was being created and tables were being created when the container was being run and the app was launched.

March 10th :

- When I ran the application on port 8080, I got a new error, saying Webpacker wasnt writing into the manifest.json file.
- I tried reading online about the error and came across some sites asking to comment a line out of application.html.erb (in ./app/views/layouts)
- I tried it but was a bit skeptical as the code was to pack the application and ideally my webpacker should do that. The change didnt evade the error.
- I thought it could be because of some version error with the webpacker gem. I tried to install it again in the entrypoint file, but the error didnt change.

- I looked up about this online again and many asked to switch to rails 7.x.x version as it no longer uses webpacker. I tried but soon realized that it wouldnt change how the rails app is configured.

March 11th :

- I tried to search up more on it and maybe figured that the manifest.json file was to be checked.
- I tried checking on it but wasnt getting anywhere.

- I tried to look up on the error by reading through the error lines while running docker compose. I noticed an error in Yarn.
- I tried reinstalling the nodejs and yarn package manager and the packages. After couple of tries and changes, it ended up loading the webpage.
- Initially I wasnt able to upload the file, but on running docker compose again, I was able to upload the file. I uploaded a file and took screenshots for this.

FINAL CHECKS :-

- Launch an Application Container (WORKS)
- Launch a separate container for the DB (WORKS)
- Connect the 2 containers (using docker-compose) (WORKS)
- DB is not exposed to the host or external network (WORKS)
- Application port is set to 8080 (WORKS)

Hence, task has been completed Successfully.
