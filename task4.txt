DOCUMENTATION FOR THE COMPLETION OF TASK 4

Name : Sricharan Sridhar
Roll No. : 221IT066

March 12th : 

- I decided to read about how to be able to launch three application images from a single Load balancer.
- I initially assumed we could define how many containers we would want to create from a single image in the docker compose file.
- I figured that it was better to just create three different services for each of the applications to be launched.

- I made sure all three depend on the same DB, that is the mysqldb.
- I also made sure that the load balancer (nginx) would depend on all three application services.

- I decided to make changes in the config file of nginx (nginx.conf), creating an upstream for all the three apps.
- This would listen to requests and balance the load between the three applications at port 3000.
- It was default with least_conn (least connections priority)

- On creating the network using docker compose, the three application servers, DB and the nginx servers launched and I was able to balance the load between the three application containers.

FINAL CHECKS :-

- Created three services for the application (WORKS)
- Link all three images to a single DB (WORKS)
- Link the load balancer to the three application services (WORKS)
- Access the application only from port 8080 (WORKS)

Hence, task has been completed Successfully.
